# Mavic Pro/Mavic Pro Platinum? Mavic Pro Artic White Super-Patcher battery mod variant

Public Beta Edition 

Model:wm220
 
Stock Firmware needed: V01.04.0300

Flight Controller# **03.02.44.88**

The Mavic Pro Battery Mod Variant inherits all mods from the original Super-Patcher flight controller but adds new smart battery configuration options. 

This variant disables all auto-landing, auto-landing, auto RTH, and low battery warnings. There is however an emergency battery level when the aircraft battery voltage per cell drops below 3.0v per cell (well below the safe voltage level.) Therefore it is up to the pilot to manually determine when its time to return home. This settings can be adjusted within Assistant 2 1.1.2 and auto-landing auto-rth and low battery wanings can all be configured to the pilot's specifications but by defualt they are all inactive. This allows the ability to keep DJI Intelligent battery mode while configuring the smart battery how they would like it.
