• Super Patcher Custom Flight Controller plus some additional widened parameter ranges. Not all max possible parameter can be considered possible or safe. This variant is meant to allow additional testing to find the true limits of the aircraft. Default values are left factory default. Never change parameters you do not know what they do! The possible value ranges for this variant have been widened greatly and have not been tested! Exteme values may have unexpected results.
