# Spark Stealth Variant

New Flight Controller #:03.02.43.99

All mods from original Super-Patcher flight controller

Rear LED light has been hard-coded to remain off during flight. This behavior cannot be changed by the user. To get the light to come back on during flight the user would need to flash back to stock or another flight controller version 

LED lights on the front arms can be turned on and off as usual. 

Rear LED light may turn on if the aircraft encounters an error which includes critical battery level. Adjust battery parameters if function is not desired.
